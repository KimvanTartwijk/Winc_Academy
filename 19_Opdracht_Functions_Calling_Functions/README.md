# Exercise Functions Calling Functions
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Call functions from other functions.

## Tools
Javascript

## Project Requirements Hey Kiddo
* create a function that has one parameter: the age
* this function should return true if the age is >= 18, false in all other cases
* think of a good name for the function and the parameter
* create a second function that has one parameter: the age
* think of a good name for the function and the parameter
* this second function uses (calls) the first function, giving it the age, to check if we get an adult age
* if it's an adult the second function should return "Hello there"
* if it's not an adult it should return "Hey kiddo"
* use console.log to display the return value of the second function


## Project Requirements Vat Calculations (1)
* First let's write a function that takes the base price and the VAT percentage and returns the price including VAT. 
* You must do the calculation of the VAT amount in a separate function.
* Make sure your functions work by testing them with different values and checking the result with a calculator or pen and paper.

## Project Requirements Vat Calculations (2)
* In this exercise we're going to calculate the base price and VAT amount. The main function you make should take the amount including VAT and the VAT percentage. 
* The return value should be an array with two elements: base price and VAT amount. Again: make sure you use two functions, where the main one calls another function to do part of the calculation.
