# Exercise Functions Calling Functions
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Call functions from other functions.

## Tools
Javascript

## Project Requirements Hey Kiddo
* Create a function that has one parameter: the age.
* This function should return true if the age is >= 18, false in all other cases.
* Create a second function that has one parameter: the age.
* This second function uses (calls) the first function, giving it the age, to check if we get an adult age.
* If it's an adult the second function should return "Hello there".
* If it's not an adult it should return "Hey kiddo".
* Use console.log to display the return value of the second function.

## Project Requirements Vat Calculations (1)
* Write a function that takes the base price and the VAT percentage and returns the price including VAT. 
* You must do the calculation of the VAT amount in a separate function.

## Project Requirements Vat Calculations (2)
* Calculate the base price and VAT amount. The main function you make should take the amount including VAT and the VAT percentage. 
* The return value should be an array with two elements: base price and VAT amount. Again: make sure you use two functions, where the main one calls another function to do part of the calculation.
