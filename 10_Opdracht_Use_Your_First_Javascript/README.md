# Exercise Use your First Javascript
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
In the next exercise, you will use the first JavaScript in your HTML page with a <script> tag.
  
## Tools
HTML, Javascript

## Project Requirements
* Create a standard HTML page, with the following h1: <h1> My first JavaScript playground </h1>
* Use the <script> tag to add Javascript
* Open this simple HTML page in your browser and open your Chrome Dev Tools. What are the Chrome Developer Tools again?
* Use console.log("Hello Winc Academy") in your JavaScript tags and open your HTML file in your browser. Reload the page, open the Chrome Developer Tools (via Settings > Inspect) and select the "console". You've also seen this in Mosh's videos.
* Use let to create (initialize) a variable and store your own name in the variable. Then console.log() your own name.
* Add the following variables together and log the result:
* Adding two numbers together: 4 + 4.
* Adding two strings together "4" + "4".

Make some simple sums with the following operators and log the result to the console. Use:
* Addition +
* Subtraction -
* Multiplication *
* Division /
* Modulus %

* Create a variable with your age in numbers (for example 48), log the type of the variable to the console with typeof (operator type)
* Now change the type of this variable by writing out your age ("48") in "text", log the type to the console with typeof.
* Use your external script.js file on your HTML page. Create a new script.js file and move all your JavaScript into this file.
