# Exercise Guess The Number Game
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Create a function with arguments.

## Tools
Javascript

## Project Requirements
No arguments
* create a new JavaScript file
* first just check if you can run it with node
* think of a good clear name for your function first
* to paint a wall print something like "The wall has been painted red" to the console
* first write a function that always paints the wall red (so no argument yet)
* call the function to check if it works

Single argument
* now add an argument to the function
* think of a good name for the argument
* change the function so it uses the argument when it runs
* if the function gets the string "green" it should print "The wall has been painted green"
* call the function to check if it works, be sure to pass an argument when you call the function
* call the function a second time, now pass in another color

Multiple arguments
* Let's add another argument. We now want to choose the wall that we want to paint.
* think of a good name for this new argument
* change the function so it takes two arguments
* change the function so it uses both arguments
* call the function to see if it works
