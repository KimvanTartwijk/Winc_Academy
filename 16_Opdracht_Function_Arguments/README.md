# Exercise Function Arguments
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Create a function with arguments.

## Tools
Javascript

## Project Requirements
No arguments
* Write a function that always paints the wall red (so no argument yet).
* Call the function.

Single argument
* Now add an argument to the function.
* Change the function so it uses the argument when it runs.
* Call the function, make sure you pass an argument.
* call the function a second time, now pass in another color.

Multiple arguments
* Let's add another argument. We now want to choose the wall that we want to paint.
* Change the function so it takes two arguments.
* Change the function so it uses both arguments.
* Call the function.
