# Exercise Guess The Number Game
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Make a game using Javascript. The computer chooses a (semi)random number. The user tries to guess it.

## Tools
Javascript

## Project Requirements
* As a user, I want an introductory message that greets the user and asks for their name. "Welcome! What is your name?"
* As a user, I want to be able to enter my name and click enter.
* As a user, after I entered my name, I want to see a message: "Hey [name]"
* As a user, after the greeting with my name, I want to be asked for a new input with a digit. For example: "Enter a number between 0 and 25 to start guessing..."
* As a game developer, I want the user to have a realistic chance to win, therefore I take a random number between 0 and 25. Hint: use Math.random()
* As a user, I want to be able to enter and number and click enter.
* As a user, I want to receive a message when I guessed the wrong number, for example: "Unfortunately, that is not correct!". Afterward, I want to be asked to guess again.
* As a user, I want to receive a message when I guess the right number, for example: "Congratulations, you have won the game!". The game is now finished.
* As a user, I want to receive a message when the game is done, for example: "Bye [name], see you!"

## Project Bonus Requirements
* A user gets a maximum of five tries to guess the number.
* As a user, I want to see how many tries I have left after every attempt.
* As a user, I want to receive a message when I have run out of tries. The game is now finished.
* A user can specify the range between the random number that will be chosen.
* As a user, at the start of the game, I want to be asked which is the smallest and which is the largest number to guess.
* As a user, I now play with the number range that I entered at the start of the game.
