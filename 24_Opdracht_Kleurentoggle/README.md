# Assignment Color Toggle
Winc Academy's final project in the Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Create a color toggle menu using JavaScript.
By clicking on the buttons of the toggle menu or pressing keys (1 to 9) the background color will change.

## Tools
HTML, CSS, Javascript

## Project Requirements
* As a user I can click on the hamburger icon and it will show me a menu of color choices.
* As a user I am allowed to pick a color from the menu(The colors are described in the menu as text). Each item in the menu is a different color.
* As a user I can only click on one color from of the menu.
* When the color is clicked on the menu, the background of the webpage will change into the picked color.
* After the color has been picked, the menu will close.

## Project Bonus Requirements
* As a user I don't want the colors in the menu described in text. I want to see them also with their corresponding color. Each "row " has a different color.
* As a user I want to click onto a radio button in the color menu, so I can see which color is "active" on that moment.
* As a user I want to open the menu when I hover over the Hamburger icon with the mouse instead of clicking on it. The menu closes when the mouse is not hovering on the hamburger icon.
* As a user I want to see the picked color name described into my webpage and it changes after changing color.
* As a user I want to see the menu sliding in and out smoothly into the screen, instead of popping out suddenly.(Use CSS transition and the direction doesn't matter)
* As a user I am able to change the color with the keyboard.
