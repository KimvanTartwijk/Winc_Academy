## Project Requirements
Part 1: Objects
* Create an object called person.
* Add the following key-value pairs / properties: name and age.
* Use console.log(person) and run your JavaScript program, to log your object.
* Only log the value of name using the key name.
* Only log age.
* Use dot-notation and bracket-notation to log the two properties above.
* Create a final key-value pair in which the key is evaluations and the value [7, 10, 9].
* Log only the property evaluations. 

Part 2: Arrays
* Create a new variable containing an empty array [].
* Fill this array with at least three different colors in the form of strings.
* Log your new array to the console.
* Log the length of your array to the console. Use array.length.
* Log the first element of your array to the console.
* Log the last element of your array to the console. Assume the amount of elements in your array is unknown.
* Add a 4th element to your array using the push method: array.push().
* Now add a digit to your array using the push method.
* Finally add an object to your array, again with the push method. The object is as follows: {greeting: "hi, I am an object"}.
* Log only the greeting from the object.
