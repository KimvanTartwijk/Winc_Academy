# Exercise Objects and Arrays
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal

## Tools
Javascript

## Project Requirements
Part 1: Objects
* Create an object called person.
* person has the following key-value pairs / properties: name and age. Fill in you own name and age.
* Use console.log(person) and run your JavaScript program, to log your object.
* Only log the value of name using the key name.
* Only log age age.
* Use dot-notation and bracket-notation to log the two properties above.
* Create a final key-value pair in which the key is evaluations and the value [7, 10, 9]. These are the marks you've received in the past year.
* Log only the property evaluations. 

Part 2: Arrays
* Create a new variable containing an empty array [].
* Fill this array with at least three different colors in the form of strings. For example: "green", "blue", "red".
* Log your new array to the console.
* Log the length of your array to the console. Use array.length.
* Log the first element of your array to the console. In our example, this would be "green".
* Log the last element of your array to the console, in our example: "red". Assume the amount of elements in your array is unknown. array[3] will not give the correct result if later on five elements are contained within the array.
* Add a 4th element to your array using the push method: array.push(). The result will be something like: ["green", "blue", "red", "Yellow"]
* Now add a digit to your array using the push method. Result: ["green", "blue", "red", "Yellow", 5]
* Finally add an object to your array, again with the push method. The object is as follows: {greeting: "hi, I am an object"}. Result: ["green", "blue",
"red", "Yellow", 5, {greeting: "hi, I am an object"}]
* Log Only the greeting from the object (last element of your array), to the console.

Part 3: A "real-life" object
O* bjects in JavaScript can be compared with objects in real life. Therefore we will continue with an exercise using a "real" object. We have created an array that contains three cat breeds. Below you will find this array with three cat breeds and their features.

```
