# Exercise Hackaton
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Create a website using HTML and CSS.

## Tools
HTML, CSS

## Project Requirements
* Use a clear subject for your website: "My website is about...".
* Create multiple pages.
* Use at least 5 different HTML elements.
* Use semantic HTML elements in the right places.
* Put CSS in a separate stylesheet (do not use inline CSS (= CSS inside of an HTML file))
* Do not use CSS frameworks.
* Use margin, padding, or border in at least 2 different places on your website. (a.k.a: prove that you know how the box-model works)
* Use at least 1 image.
* Use at least 2 links.
* Use media queries, making your website look different on mobile and desktop.
* Create at least 1 form.
* Your website should be mobile-first. Your base CSS should be for mobile devices. Use media queries to make your website look nice on desktop. Don't forget the mobile view meta-tag (see note below).

We will pay attention to the cleanliness of your code:
* Pay attention to any spelling errors (use a linter).
* Make sure your code is formatted correctly. Use spaces and enters properly.
* Note: Don't forget to add the following HTML meta-tag to the <head> element in index.html:

```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
This will make sure your website is viewed with the proper scale on mobile. Without this tag, some mobile devices will use a different resolution. When this happens, the mobile screen may end up showing CSS that was intended for desktop views.
```
  
## Project Bonus requirements
* embed a YouTube video.
* Use a lot of pretty images, such as those from stock photo websites.
* Use media queries for more screen sizes, such as a tablet.
* Use colors that work well together.
* Use external libraries like Google Fonts to add extra CSS to your website.
* Use a more complex form with many different types of input fields.
