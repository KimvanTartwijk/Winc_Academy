# Exercise Use if-else Statements
An Exercise in Winc Academy's Web Development Course.

## Project Goal
Write an if-else statement.

## Tools
Javascript

## Project Requirements
Part 1:
* Create a const called age and give it a value of type number.
* Write an if-statement that checks whether the age of the person (the input) is greater than 18 years.
* Console.log() a message to the console when the person is allowed in.
* Console.log() another message when the person is too young and is kindly requested to stay outside.

Part 2:
* Write a new const called isFemale with a boolean value.
* Write an if statement that checks whether the input is true or false.
* Console.log() something back to the console when the value is true and when the value is false.

Part 3:
* Write a new const called driverStatus with the value 'designated'.
* Write an if statement that checks if the driverStatus input is equal to 'designated'.
* Console.log() a message if the driver has the "designated" status and is allowed to drive.
* Console.log() a message if the driver does not have the "designated" status and is therefore not allowed to drive.
